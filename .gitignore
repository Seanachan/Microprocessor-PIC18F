# CLion
#  JetBrains specific template is maintained in a separate JetBrains.gitignore that can
#  be found at https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Global/JetBrains.gitignore
#  and can be added to the global gitignore or merged into this file.  For a more nuclear
#  option (not recommended) you can uncomment the following to ignore the entire idea folder.
#cmake-build-*

# Ignore everything
*

# But track .asm files in any folder
!**/*.asm
!**/*.c

# And don't ignore directories (needed for tracking files in subdirectories)
